This is less of a functional website, and more of a programming learning experience. 
This flask was used to create the base of my site: [https://john-b-yang.github.io/flask-website/](https://john-b-yang.github.io/flask-website/)

I learned how to build a website, create and modify pages, create a working medu bar, create and modify background colours, and reorganize and personalizes pieces of templates. 

I learned beginner CSS styling. Using two CSS style templates from W3 Schools templates: https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_templates.asp I created my own look with image previews. 

I have included 2 of my works in the site so far as well as a cover photo which is a self-portrait. 
https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/ This guide by Roger Dudler was very helpful to me. It taught me about repositories, adding and committing, and pushing changes. 

This is an ongoing project for me as I teach myself to code interactive platforms.
